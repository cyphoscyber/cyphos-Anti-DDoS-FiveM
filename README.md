# What is Cyphos Anti-DDoS?
It is hard to protect your gaming server against powerful network attacks. Cyphos makes DDoS protection free and easy for everyone, so you do not have to worry about network attacks anymore.

# How Cyphos Anti-DDoS works?
Cyphos has a complex protection system. You just have to register an account on Cyphos website and then add your server details (server name, IP) in the dashboard. Once that is done, you will be given access to a resource where you have to add our endpoint IP address that will vacuum all your server traffic through their systems. So all that bad traffic (DDoS) you get will be halted and only the legitimate traffic will pass to your server making it's invulnerable for DDoS attacks.

# How to setup?
A detailed guide can be found in your Cyphos dashboard with the details of all the requirements.

# Note
If you change the information or resource name, the service will be halted and the traffic to your server will not be routed through our mitigation service, making you vulnerable to DDoS attacks.

This service is still in beta, which is why we are offering it for free. This is subject to change in the future.
